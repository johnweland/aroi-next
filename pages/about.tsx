            <p>Aroi Thai Cuisine started off as a hope and a dream. In the spring of 2021. We found an old DAC buss for sale and were planning on purchasing and remodeling it into a food truck. The loan fell through but we were presented with another opportunity with our current trailer. We were able to secure the funds necessary for the trailer and truck and the rest is history.</p>
            <br />
            <p>It took quite a bit of doing however. After acquiring the trailer it was business license this and food protection certificate that. It felt like one thing after another was keeping us from opening. However, after several months we managed to dot our i’s and cross our t’s and opened for the first time on July 22, 2021. Ever since it has been an interesting ride.</p>
            <br />
            <p>We would be no where with out you, our loyal customers and fans. We thank you with all our heart!</p>
